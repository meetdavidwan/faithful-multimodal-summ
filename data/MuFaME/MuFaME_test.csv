Pisces are thought to be dreamers, compassionate, artistic, intuitive, romantic, spiritual, melancholy, tolerant, and forgiving. Do a little investigating to see if your love interest has the traits of a typical Pisces. Check out the person's social media for hints — see what the person's interest are, what music they like, their style, if there are any particular causes they support (it would be very ""Pisces"" to support ecological organizations), and so on. This can help you figure out if the person has the qualities of a Pisces and, more importantly, if this is someone with whom you share interests and values. A typical Pisces will also likely spend a lot of time near the water; they could be a swimmer or just love going to the beach. Music is very important to a typical Pisces. Notice if the Pisces is always posting online or talking about new bands, going to concerts and festivals, and so on.

Work, school, exercise, paying the bills and preparing meals can all be stressful, so having activities to help you unwind before bedtime can help promote better sleep and either combat insomnia or reduce the risk of it developing. Various relaxation techniques are proven to calm the brain and body, such as progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing techniques. Progressive muscle relaxation or PMR teaches you how to relax your muscles through a 2- step process: first, you intentionally tense muscle groups in your body, such as your neck and shoulders; next, you release the tension, focusing intensely on 1 body part at a time. Try this each night before bedtime. Deep breathing techniques prior to bed can help you relax and get to sleep. Place a hand on your lower abdomen and breathe in deeply so your hand rises (called stomach breathing). Hold your breath for a count of 3 and then exhale fully and watch your hand fall. Do these 3x per night. A warm bath can also help cure insomnia. Make sure the water isn't too hot and add a couple scoops of Epsom salts — it's rich with magnesium, which can absorb through your skin and relax muscles. Light some candles.

33055_1_0,mof,"Chiropractors and osteopaths are spinal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function of the small spinal joints that connect the vertebrae, called spinal facet joints. Manual joint manipulation, also called an adjustment, can be used to unjam or reposition facet joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain, particularly with movement. Although a single spinal adjustment can sometimes completely relieve your back pain, more than likely it will take 3-5 treatments to notice significant results. Your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care. Chiropractors and osteopaths also use a variety of therapies tailored more towards muscle strains, which may be more appropriate for your back issue. Traction techniques or stretching of your spine with an inversion table may also help your back pain. Some chiropractors have inversion tables in their offices, which allows you to turn yourself upside down in a controlled and easy way, enlisting the help of gravity to decompress your spine. Consider buying an inversion table for home use.",Look for a pain.,https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/62/Get-Rid-of-Bad-Back-Pain-Step-7-Version-3.jpg/v4-460px-Get-Rid-of-Bad-Back-Pain-Step-7-Version-3.jpg,0,0,0.0,0

You want standard 4"" overlays (both vertical and horizontal), 1/2"" hems, and a fullness ratio of 1.8 for a gathered heading style. You would like your curtains to be broken up into two panels. Your final estimated width would be: The width (48"") plus twice the overlay (4""). You would then divide this length (56"") by the number of panels (2). Next, add four times the hem (0.5""). Finally, multiply this final number (30"") by the fullness ratio (1.8), yielding a width of 54"". This can also be expressed with the equation 1.8 x ((48 + 2 x 4)/2 + 4 x 0.5) = 54. Your final estimated height would be a much simpler: Just add the height of the window (36"") to four times the hem (0.5"") along with the overlay (4"") and distance to the rod (6"").

For example, let's say you're working with a 48""-wide, 36""-tall window with a curtain rod 6"" above. You want standard 4"" overlays (both vertical and horizontal), 1/2"" hems, and a fullness ratio of 1.8 for a gathered heading style. You would like your curtains to be broken up into two panels. Your final estimated width would be: The width (48"") plus twice the overlay (4""). You would then divide this length (56"") by the number of panels (2). Next, add four times the hem (0.5""). Finally, multiply this final number (30"") by the fullness ratio (1.8), yielding a width of 54"". This can also be expressed with the equation 1.8 x ((48 + 2 x 4)/2 + 4 x 0.5) = 54. Your final estimated height would be a much simpler: Just add the height of the window (36"") to four times the hem (0.5"") along with the overlay (4"") and distance to the rod (6"").
