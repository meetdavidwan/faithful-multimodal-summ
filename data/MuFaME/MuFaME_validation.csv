9391_1_1,reference,"Before sitting down to cut your cat’s nails, be sure you have the right equipment to do so. To trim your cat's nails, you’ll need a pair of nail clippers designed to clip cat claws and a styptic pencil. There are several different styles of nail clippers, all of which largely do the same job. The most important thing is that the clippers are sharp, so they snip straight through the claw. Not only will using dull clippers make the job longer and harder, but you may also end up squeezing the quick, which can be painful for the cat. There are two primary styles of clipper: scissor and guillotine clippers. Scissor clippers cut a cat’s nails using a scissor motion and usually come in small and large sizes. The small “nippers” tend to be better for those new to clipping nails or if you just need to snip the tips. Larger scissor clippers are suited to cutting older, tougher nails. Guillotine clippers use a sliding blade that cuts the nail when you squeeze the handles together. The claw fits into a slot and the blade slides across to clip the nail. These are strong clippers that are good for cutting long, thick nails (but not overgrown nails--large clippers are better suited to that). If the clippers are sharp the cat won't feel the quick clip. Clippers don't stay sharp forever, so discard them (or send them for sharpening) if you suspect the blades have gone dull. Signs of this include having to apply a lot of pressure to cut the nail or the nail being “chewed” by the clippers rather than making a clean cut. Also have a styptic pencil on hand in case you cut the cat’s quick (which is less likely with a cat than a dog, as the cat's quick is much shorter). Styptic pencils are readily available from pharmacies (typically in the shaving section). They cauterize blood vessels when touched to the nail and help prevent bleeding. If you cut the quick, you can hold the styptic pencil to the claw for 1 - 2 minutes and the bleeding should stop.",Use the right tools.,https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6a/Trim-Your-Cat%27s-Nails-Step-7-Version-7.jpg/v4-460px-Trim-Your-Cat%27s-Nails-Step-7-Version-7.jpg,1,1,1.0,0

9391_1_1,t5,"Before sitting down to cut your cat’s nails, be sure you have the right equipment to do so. To trim your cat's nails, you’ll need a pair of nail clippers designed to clip cat claws and a styptic pencil. There are several different styles of nail clippers, all of which largely do the same job. The most important thing is that the clippers are sharp, so they snip straight through the claw. Not only will using dull clippers make the job longer and harder, but you may also end up squeezing the quick, which can be painful for the cat. There are two primary styles of clipper: scissor and guillotine clippers. Scissor clippers cut a cat’s nails using a scissor motion and usually come in small and large sizes. The small “nippers” tend to be better for those new to clipping nails or if you just need to snip the tips. Larger scissor clippers are suited to cutting older, tougher nails. Guillotine clippers use a sliding blade that cuts the nail when you squeeze the handles together. The claw fits into a slot and the blade slides across to clip the nail. These are strong clippers that are good for cutting long, thick nails (but not overgrown nails--large clippers are better suited to that). If the clippers are sharp the cat won't feel the quick clip. Clippers don't stay sharp forever, so discard them (or send them for sharpening) if you suspect the blades have gone dull. Signs of this include having to apply a lot of pressure to cut the nail or the nail being “chewed” by the clippers rather than making a clean cut. Also have a styptic pencil on hand in case you cut the cat’s quick (which is less likely with a cat than a dog, as the cat's quick is much shorter). Styptic pencils are readily available from pharmacies (typically in the shaving section). They cauterize blood vessels when touched to the nail and help prevent bleeding. If you cut the quick, you can hold the styptic pencil to the claw for 1 - 2 minutes and the bleeding should stop.",Use a pair of nail clippers.,https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/6a/Trim-Your-Cat%27s-Nails-Step-7-Version-7.jpg/v4-460px-Trim-Your-Cat%27s-Nails-Step-7-Version-7.jpg,1,1,1.0,2
